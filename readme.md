## Features  

### VIA Enabled  
Easily remap keys, configure layers, and customize RGB lighting using the [Via Configurator](https://usevia.app/).  

### Sentence Case
Toggle sentence case mode with `Fn + Caps Lock`. The feature is off by default and capitalizes the first letter of each sentence when enabled.

### Win Lock
Toggle the Windows key lock with `Fn + Win`. When enabled, both operating-system keys are blocked and the Win key glows red on the base layer.

### SOCD Mode Cycle
Hold `Fn`, keep `Right Shift` pressed to access the SOCD layer, then press `S` to cycle simultaneous-opposite cardinal direction (SOCD) handling between **Last Input Wins**, **Neutral**, and **First Input Wins**. Each selection triggers dedicated function-row lighting feedback so you always know which mode is active.

### NKRO Toggle
Hold `Fn`, keep `Right Shift` pressed, then tap `N` to toggle between the default **6KRO** and **NKRO** reporting. Lighting feedback confirms the currently selected mode.

### Layer Lighting
- **Layers 0â€“2**: Solid orange (RGB 255, 95, 64) by defaultâ€”fully adjustable in VIA. Win Lock (red) and Sentence Case (green) status are indicated on the Windows and Caps Lock keys.
- **Layer 3 (Fn)**: All keys are dark except **Enter**, **Right Shift**, **Caps Lock**, and **Win**, which illuminate according to their functions and toggle states.
- **Layer 4 (SOCD/NKRO)**: Highlights the SOCD (`S`) and NKRO (`N`) controls in purple and orange respectively, along with numeric indicators for the active mode.
- **Layer 5 (System)**: Emphasizes the DFU (`Esc`) and EEPROM Clear (`E`) controls in red.

### Night Mode
- Tap `PgDn` on the base layer to toggle layers 0â€“2 between the VIA-selected color/brightness and the stored **Night** preset.
- Hold `Fn` (momentary layer 3) and press `PgDn` to capture the current VIA hue/brightness as the new **Night** preset (saved to EEPROM). The firmware ships with #ff985a at 10â€¯% brightness as the default Night profile.

Layers 1 and 2 ship as clones of the base typing layer so you have two blank canvases ready for VIA custom layouts.

### Knob Controls
- **Layers 0â€“2**: Volume control (counter-clockwise = volume down, clockwise = volume up, press = mute)

### DFU Mode
Hold `Fn`, keep `Enter` pressed (momentary Layer 5), then tap `Esc`. The whole board flashes red for 0.5 s before entering the bootloader.

### Clear EEPROM
Hold `Fn`, keep `Enter` pressed, then tap `E`. The keys `{3, 4, R, F, C, X, S, W}` flash red for 0.5 s before the EEPROM is cleared and the board resets.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

#### To Flash Firmware  
1. Install [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to flash firmware onto your keyboard.  

#### To Compile Firmware  
1. Set up your [QMK environment](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_getting_started) to compile and modify the firmware source code.  

---

### Flashing the Firmware  

1. **Download the Firmware**:  
   - Clone this repository or download the `.hex` file from the `Compiled` folder.  

2. **Flash the Firmware**:  
    - Enter DFU mode by holding `Fn`, keeping `Enter` pressed, then tapping `Esc`.
    - Alternatively, press the `ESC` key while plugging in the USB cable, or use the reset button located under the space bar.
   - Use **QMK Toolbox** to flash the `lazercore.hex` file to your keyboard.

### Compiling the Firmware  

1. Copy the `RK75` folder to the `keyboards` folder in your QMK firmware environment.  
2. Run the following command to compile the firmware:  
     ``` qmk compile -kb RK75 -km lazercore ``` (or) ```make RK75:lazercore -j```
